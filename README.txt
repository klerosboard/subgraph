## Smart Contracts
All the tracking of this grpah will be done checking the events of the KlerosLiquid smart contract, and the Policy Registry contract.
Kleros Liquid SC is deployed at [0x988b...8069](etherscan.com/address/0x988b3A538b618C7A603e1c11Ab82Cd16dbE28069)
PolicyRegistry is deployed at [0xCf1f...ECe4](etherscan.com/address/0xCf1f07713d5193FaE5c1653C9f61953D048BECe4).
#### Kleros Liquid events of interest:
* setStake (when a juror stake pnk in some court). This event returns the current stake and the total current stake (total is the stake of the juror in all the subcourts).

* draw (emitted when a jurors is drawn in a case).
* TokenAndETHShift (emmited when a juror win or lose tokens and ETH from the case)
#### KlerosLiquid functions calls of interest:
* createSubcourt
Besides is not the best performance to track functions calls, is the only way to track the creation of a new subcourt.
